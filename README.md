# Deck Of Cards

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3.

This is an application to simulate a deck of cards using the [Deck of Cards API](https://www.deckofcardsapi.com/).

Your virtual deck will get generated and shuffled and you will be asked 3 questions about the next card that will be drawn. 

You can try the application [HERE](https://deck-of-cards-roan.vercel.app/)

Good luck and enjoy!
